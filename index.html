  <h1>One Laptop per Child</h1>
  <p> One Laptop per Child is a <b>nonprofit</b> organization that aims to create educational opportunities for the worlds poorest children.

  <h2>5 Core Principles</h2>
  <p> One Laptop per Child's mission revolves around these 5 Core Principles:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><b>Kids get to take the Laptops home</b></li>
    <p>This allows access to information for the child and the family at any time</p>
    <li><b>Focus on Early Education</b></li>
    <p>To develop a love for learning at an early age and motivate children to study</p>
    <li><b>Every child recieves a laptop</b></li>
    <p>Allows for individual access to knowledge and a sense of ownership</p>
    <li><b>Connectivity</b></li>
    <p>For interaction with information beyond a childs borders</p>
    <li><b>Free and Open Source Software</b></li>
    <p>Children can explore programs and design software at their own pace</p>
  </ol>
<p>These 5 Core Principles help focus the organizations efforts in a way that is most impactful to the purpose of the mission. One laptop per Child makes this powerful educational tool available to children all over the world who otherwise do not have the resources for acquiring a laptop. By having a laptop, they have access to a wealth of information and educational activities that they can share with each other through the XO's networking system.</p>
